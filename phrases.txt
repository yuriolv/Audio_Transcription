I was went to the park yesterday with my friends. We has a lot of fun, and we play soccer for hours. The weather was very good, and the sun was shining bright. We don't know why, but we was very tired after that. I didn't eat much breakfast, so I was hungry during the game. My friend Mark, he bring some snacks, but I forget to take water. We took many pictures because we wants to remember that day. At the end, we all sat down and talk about our plans for the next weekend. I hope we can do it again soon, maybe next Saturday. I didn't like that we left so early, but we had to go back home. I want go to the park more often, because it's fun and healthy.
